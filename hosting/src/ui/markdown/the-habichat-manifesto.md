As someone who's moved 5 times in the last 10 years, I've gotten used to the feeling of settling in to a new city as a complete stranger. I've learned many things from making new friends over and over again and as a naturally social person I know that having a community of important people around me increases my quality of life tenfold. If there's one thing I've realized about starting over in a new city it's that geography plays an important role in the relationships we build. Having Important people near us matters and this is what social media gets so wrong.

So I decided to do something about it - it just so happens that I'm a software developer who's worked on many large applications at the CBC, rTraction and Telus Digital. I recently took a sabatical from work and I decided to strap myself down and start sketching out wireframes, modelling databases, and enrolling myself in Y Combinator's Start-up school. Much like any good idea, the first step to success is to test the viability of my idea - so I created this website and this blog as a way to communicate what I'm trying to do with the world. 

I want habichat to connect communities together across Canada but first, I need to test things on a smaller scale. So I'm asking residents of Montreal and specifically Ville Ã‰mard to help me gain some valuable market research. If you're someone who lives in the area, you are a digital connector, and you'd like to help collaborate together - please join our [Slack Channel](http://slack.habi.chat/) 
 or shoot over an [Email](mailto:hello@habi.chat). I can't wait to see what amazing things we come up with.
