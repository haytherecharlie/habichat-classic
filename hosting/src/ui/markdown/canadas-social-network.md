Over the past few days We've been hard at work not only preparing the site for launch, but also working on my elevator pitch for what Habichat will be. Long-winded descriptions and fancy buzz-words aside, I realized that the competetors we face as a start-up are fundimentally different in one key manner - they're not Canadian. In fact, there are no Canadian social media companies, and that's a bigger problem than you may realize.

If you haven't heard of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) then you may not be someone who has fears about data privacy and ownership. But whether you are informed or not about it's existance, the GDPR is becoming commonplace around the globe. The European Union was the first to pass it into law, and since then many more governments around the world are instilling it's rules to protect the private information of it's citizens. The GDPR ensures transparency and modality, the right to be forgotten, the right to reject automated decisions, anonymisation, and encryption. The Qu√©bec government has already began working towards ratifying the GDPR within the provice and I'm sure the rest of Canada will soon follow.

It's important that Habichat is Canadian because America is slow to adopt these policies, information is openly shared with government agencies and even if you are a Canadian citizen, most of your information is sent to the United States to be stored and processed however these companies see fit.

Habichat, on the other hand, stores your data only in Canadian data centers. We're forward thinking about privacy, and most importantly we believe that Canadian's should have access to a world class social media site without surrendering what we share with foreign governments. The dream is there, it's time for us to make it a reality.
