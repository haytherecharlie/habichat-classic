## Introduction:

Hello Twitter! My name is Charlie Hay, I'm a Tech Lead at TELUS Digital with a passion for React.js and UX Design. I've been coding my whole life, my father was a Computer Science graduate from the University of Western Ontario, and I remember creating my own websites since I was 11 years old. 

For the longest time Twitter has been a major inspiration to my work - ever since the early bootstrap days. Now I'm all about creating design systems and using color to showcase emphasis. I'm loving life in the React ecosystem from Gatsby to Next.js to React Native and Expo, I'm always working on something new. 

I created _habichat_ as an homage to Twitter.com, I put my personal flare on the project by creating it as a "local social network" aimed at building communities based on postal codes instead of interests or countries. You see, I love bringing people together with my work, and I would be incredibly excited to bring my abilities to the team at Twitter!

Please browse this code base and check out the [habichat website](https://habi.chat) to see that I'm seriously passionate about working together with you!

All the best, 

Charlie Hay
